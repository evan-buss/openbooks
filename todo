Future:

- Show IRC logs in the browser
- Show online servers in the CLI.
- Handle IRC name collisions
- Simplify dto model calling code in Go. Don't need as many types.
- Allow reconnecting to same IRC connection if websocket disconnects.
  - Currently we immediately terminate the IRC connection and remove the client
  - Possible use a timer that keeps the Client around for a set period of time
    after websocket disconnect.
- Convert grid to use React Grid instead of Evergreen's built in one.
  - Things like styling are more difficult with Evergreen (ex. can't round the bottom corners)
- Send download progress updates to the browser like we show for the CLI
- Improve message formats.
  - Don't need as many separate message types. Just have functions that create them with the appropriate status code.
- Log the address to access it in the browser on startup
