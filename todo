Future:

  - Show server status indicator in the grid rows
  - Show IRC logs in the browser
  - Show online servers in the CLI.
  - Handle name collisions
  - Simplify dto model calling code in Go. Don't need as many types.
  - Allow reconnecting to same IRC connection if websocket disconnects.
    - Currently we immediately terminate the IRC connection and remove the client
    - Possible use a timer that keeps the Client around for a set period of time
      after websocket disconnect.
  - Convert grid to use React Grid instead of Evergreen's built in one.
    - Things like styling are more difficult with Evergreen (ex. can't round the bottom corners)
  - Send download progress updates to the browser like we show for the CLI
  - Improve message formats. 
    - Don't need as many separate message types. Just have functions that create them with the appropriate status code.
  - Log the address to access it in the browser on startup
  - When the results contain only lines that couldn't be parsed,
    the grid doesn't show and user can't manually download.
  - Prevent double clicking the download button.
