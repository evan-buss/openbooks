WEB UI
- Make sure we delete the files in the temp directory after sending them
  - Might save the search results file and allow users to select a previous search

- Clean up and review core go code. I am sure there are some things that can be simplified and refactored.

- Write some tests for things simple things like utilities

- Look into go logging. Learn how to change the logger output before release.


REACH:
- Improve parsing accuracy with "per-server" parsing functions
   - Each one adapted to the common format for that server
   - Would require studying the format of the server with multiple search files..
   - Something to do in the future

- Exit / Shutdown button on the web interface...
- Custom favicon
- Make the table fit different screen sizes
- Make sure to delete the proper files to reduce file system build up
- Reduce the number of notificatitons. It is very IN YOUR FACE for a new user
- Update readme to describe both modes and how the project works.
- Recent search width needs to be extended to match sider width
- Center headerbar text relative to content body
- Table doesn't seem to be going inactive when loading...
  - There should be a loing indicator when use has clicked download as well
  - Might be able to keep state in the table but it might get confusing with the global loading as well
- Remove old logs
   - book string log somewhere
- Add results number to top of table 

What I've learned today
  Always use the utility library if avaiablable
    Not worth it to roll your own reader / writer just use bufio
    Go channels are very cool. It is easy to have an immensely multi-threaded application
