Future:

- Show IRC logs in the browser
- Handle IRC name collisions
- OpenAPI docs
- OPDS server to search / downoad on KOReader directly

Ideas:
- Connection pooling to IRC to allow multi users at the same time.
  - I no longer think it's possible to multi-plex a single connection and route the responses to the correct user.
    There just isn't enough information to correlate the responses to the correct user. I've thought of using invisible characters in the messages, 
    but even then the responses wouldn't have it and it's not guarantted that the requests won't be rejected..
  - Instead, we could have a pool of connections and assign a connection to a user when they connect. If none are available, we deny the connection.
    - The config could have a set of usernames that would be the limit of connections for that server.
