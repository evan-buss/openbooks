WEB UI
- Improve styling
  - UI library or styled components or style modules

- Add a more robust table. Enable filtering, searching, and sorting

- Make sure we delete the files in the temp directory after sending them
  - Might save the search results file and allow users to select a previous search

- Use popup notifications instead of a simple h1 at the top


- I am leaning towards using ANT design. It seems to have a bunch of well-made components with minimal need of customization

- Clean up and review core go code. I am sure there are some things that can be simplified and refactored.

- Refactor a bunch of code both in this project and my others that use manual path processing
 - the "path" library is AMAZING

- Write some tests for things simple things like utilities

- Things no longer have to live inside the go path!! I put projects anywhere wowee

- Fix the connection so that everytime the browser refreshes you shouldn't have to wait and the IRC connection should not be restarted.
