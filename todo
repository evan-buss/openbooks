Future:

- Show IRC logs in the browser
- Handle IRC name collisions
- Allow reconnecting to same IRC connection if websocket disconnects.
  - Currently we immediately terminate the IRC connection and remove the client
  - Possible use a timer that keeps the Client around for a set period of time
    after websocket disconnect.
- Send download progress updates to the browser like we show for the CLI
