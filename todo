Future:

  - Show server status indicator in the grid rows
  - Show IRC logs in the browser
  - Allow reconnecting to same IRC connection if websocket disconnects.
    - Currently we immediately terminate the IRC connection and remove the client
    - Possible use a timer that keeps the Client around for a set period of time
      after websocket disconnect.
  - Convert grid to use React Grid instead of Evergreen's built in one.
    - Things like styling are more difficult with Evergreen (ex. can't round the bottom corners)
  - Send download progress updates to the browser like we show for the CLI
